# PLAYME Server

## What does it do?
Basically, it just hosts an HTTP server and sends a 3D scene to those who access the page. It's particularly useful for interactive GitHub READMEs.

## Building
Go to the 'newstuff' folder and either build the dynamic or static server. Example code:
```
gcc serve_dynamic.c -o server
```

## Run the stuff
Now just run the server with:
```
./server
```
